# Weather-app

Developed a React-based weather application where anyone can view the current weather of their city. Users can access real-time weather data, including temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity, wind speed, as well as sunrise and sunset timings. Throughout this project, you utilized multiple React hooks to efficiently manage the state and interact with the real-time weather API to fetch data for any city the user desires. With the user-friendly interface and dynamic features, your weather app provides an excellent experience for users seeking up-to-date weather information.
